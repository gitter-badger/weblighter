weblighter
==========

Weblighter is an extremely light but powerful php mvc framework for developers.

Features
========

- independant of your web applications (weblighter can be outside of any public location, this allow you to have the same and unique weblighter for all your projects)
- dynamic router (with variables) works with or without url rewriting
- easy and fast rendering template system. We don't use cache files. Our framework is so fast it doesn't have to hide in cache files.
- can now render markdown too, thanks to Parsedown
- extremely fast. We use PHP, only that. We don't depend on any other framework.

Example
=======

app/ folder is just an application example. You can reuse this app folder when starting a project.
